# Documentation scaffold
Documentation scaffold so that OSS projects follow a common pattern.

Sections structure is predefined so it is easier to find and navigate
to the required information.

## How to
Copy `README.tpl.md` file as `README.md` file into your project and
modify as suggested.

Resulting `README.md` should not contain frequently asked questions,
workarounds or other non-structured technical information.
Use issue tracker for these instead.
